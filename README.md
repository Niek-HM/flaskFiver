# Welcome to my Y6 informatica project!

## About
For this project I am trying to make a website based on flask and sql where you can buy/sell products. Some of the features are:

1. Register/login, You can create and login to your account which will be saved in a database/session.
2. Buy/sell, You can become a vendor and sell your products
3. Search, you can search for any user/product and view all the necisary info
4. Settings, we will have privacy settings and other options specific to your account
5. Safety, you can report people who are scamming or practicing other harmfull behavoir.
6. *Think of more features later :)

## Running this project
If you want to run this project you will have to download multiple packages. But if you have python3 it should automatically work if you enable the venv. 

But for everyone who wants to make their own versions:

1. Flask
2. sqlite
3. waitress -- This was removed in the latest version to allow for hosting on pythonanywhere.com
4. bcrypt
5. dotenv

This should be everything since the rest of the dependencies are automatically installed with python. If anything is missing, please open a issue.

## What did i learn
For this project i used flask for the first time together with SQL. With this i first experienced a couple of problems since i have not used them together yet. Also was it new for me to code a website at sutch a low level giving me mutch more freedom with a trade of in the dificulty.
