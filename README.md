# Welcome to my Y6 informatica project!

## About
For this project I am trying to make a website based on flask and sql where you can buy/sell products. Some of the features are:

1. Register/login, You can create and login to your account which will be saved in a database/session.
2. Buy/sell, You can become a vendor and sell your products
3. Search, you can search for any user/product and view all the necisary info
4. Settings, we will have privacy settings and other options specific to your account
5. Safety, you can report people who are scamming or practicing other harmfull behavoir.
6. *Think of more features later :)

## Running this project
If you want to run this project you will have to download multiple packages. But if you have python3 it should automatically work if you enable the venv. 

But for everyone who wants to make their own versions:

1. Flask
2. sqlite
3. waitress
4. bcrypt
5. dotenv

This should be everything since the rest of the dependencies are automatically installed with python. If anything is missing, please open a issue.
